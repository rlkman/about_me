      <p>Hello, I am Nicole. I moved from Bremerton to Seattle about 7 years ago to attend the University of Washington. I was on track to major in Math, but after a couple years decided to reevaluate my life track, and decided to take some time off from school so that I could work and figure out what I wanted to do as a career.</p>
      <p>For the past 5 years, I have worked in the service industry. I started as a waitress and moved my way up into bartending. Currently, I bartend for Din Tai Fung in University Village, as well as Trinity Nightclub downtown every once in a while.</p>
      <h2>Goals for my future</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To graduate from Code Fellows</li>
        <li>Get a job with a Seattle tech company</li>
        <li>Expand my photography business on the side</li>
      </ul>
